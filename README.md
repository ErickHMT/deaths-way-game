# Death's Way

Unfinished project created during [Ludum dare 50](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50) whose theme was "Delay the inevitable".
Ludum Dare is an event where you create a game from scratch in a weekend based on a theme.

Although the project is not finished, it is still a very fun experience that tells the story of Mr. snot, a man who decides to accept 
the challenge of death to try to postpone the inevitable.
